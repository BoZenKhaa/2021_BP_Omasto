This thesis deals with the contribution to open-source Julia package \newline \textit{JuliaPOMDP/FiniteHorizonPOMDPs} \cite{FHPOMDP} a part of the more splendid library \textit{JuliaPOMDPs} \cite{JuliaPOMDP}. Its task is to implement an interface for Finite-Horizon evaluations of MDPs. We introduced MDPs and their features, then built the essential MDP solvers theory, showed their advantages and disadvantages, and further improved these methods with prioritization. On its intuition, we finally presented the Finite-Horizon MDPs and summarized why it could be beneficial to use them instead of the Infinite-Horizon ones. 

RESULTS SHOW >>>>>>>


We believe that the package will be of fair use to everyone out there searching for a way to solve their Finite-Horizon MDP  problem with an already written package that is also efficient. The \textit{JuliaPOMDP} \cite{JuliaPOMDP} is an excellent designed general package for work with MDPs, and with the advent of Julia, it will get even more attention.

In future work, our main goal is to add POMDPs solver, improve the algorithm's efficiency and to create a package rewarding the user for its use.

In conclusion, our project is on its way to deliver a great package and further improve its library environment. With the rise of Julia, it is the best time to contribute to Julian open-source packages.
